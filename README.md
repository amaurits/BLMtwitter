# BLMtwitter: The Black Lives Matter (BLM) Twitter Corpus
## Tracking an increasingly global social movement on social media

The May, 2020, murder of George Floyd led to protests throughout the United States and around the world. Along with these protests, social media platforms saw a dramatic increase in the volume of discussion regarding Black Lives Matter (BLM). Two years on, online discussion of BLM continues to be lively, not just in the United States but also internationally. This repository hosts one of the most extensive collections of Black Lives Matter tweets available, covering from 2010 through July 2022 (\*) and including over 50 million tweets overall. Parallel corpora for All Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter are also available. 

The repository itself holds monthly updates for the BLMtwitter corpus in 2022 (currently through July 2022). The full dataset, along with the All LM and Blue LM datasets, are available on Zenodo, at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7155210.  

An associated paper describes the corpus construction process, including selection criteria for tweets using the BLM acronym. It also provides a summary description of key dimensions of the three corpora, including patterns in tweet counts over time as well as the number of distinct users and the volume of tweets in languages other than English. The paper is available as part of the repository, and on SocArxiv (DOI: 10.31235/osf.io/kna9s).
